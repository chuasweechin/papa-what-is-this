# Papa, what is this?

Implemented using React and Google Vision, Text to Speech and Storage API

# Why am I building this?
Being a father to 2 kids, one of the things my kids usually ask me, "Papa, what is this?"
Because I want to answer their question quickly, I have created this app that allows me to upload an image to answer them this.

# Issue encountered for Heroku deployment
- Do not use cross-env in package.json for production build
- Ensure file pathing works across different machines
